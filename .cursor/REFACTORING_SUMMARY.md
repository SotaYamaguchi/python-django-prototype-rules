- **Added Context7 references** for browser automation patterns

#### New Comprehensive Sections
- **Testing Strategy & Best Practices**: Systematic approach with Context7 MCP integration
- **Documentation & Visual Records**: Screenshot management and issue tracking
- **Django Integration Testing**: Specific testing scenarios for Django applications

### 4. New Context7 MCP Specialized Rules

#### Context7 MCP Usage Rules (`context7-mcp-usage.mdc`)
- **Primary documentation source**: Context7 MCP as first choice for all library documentation
- **Library resolution workflow**: Step-by-step process for finding and using libraries
- **Documentation retrieval best practices**: Token optimization and targeted searches
- **Integration points**: Specific guidance for Django, Playwright, and performance optimization
- **Quality assurance**: Verification and cross-referencing strategies

#### MCP Integration Rules (`mcp-integration.mdc`)
- **Multi-MCP ecosystem**: Coordinated usage of Context7, Playwright, and DeepWiki MCP
- **Development workflow phases**: Research → Implementation → Visual Verification → Documentation
- **Cross-MCP workflows**: Specific patterns for Django API development and performance optimization
- **Quality assurance**: Comprehensive testing strategy using multiple MCP servers
- **Troubleshooting guidance**: Handling MCP server issues and fallback strategies

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. Reduced Complexity
- Consolidated related rules into single, comprehensive documents
- Eliminated duplication between files
- Simplified rule navigation and reference

### 2. Enhanced Completeness
- **Integrated Context7 MCP** as primary documentation source across all workflows
- Added missing modern Django development practices
- Included performance optimization guidelines with Context7 MCP references
- Added comprehensive testing strategies with Context7 research integration
- Enhanced security and deployment considerations
- **Added real-time documentation access** through Context7 MCP integration

### 3. Improved Accuracy
- Fixed incorrect Playwright MCP tool references
- Updated tool usage to match actual available functionality
- Standardized formatting and structure across all rules

### 4. Better Developer Experience
- **Context7 MCP integration** provides instant access to up-to-date documentation
- More logical organization of information
- Step-by-step workflows for complex processes
- Clear categorization of different types of guidelines
- Enhanced practical examples and usage patterns
- **Multi-MCP coordination** for comprehensive development workflow

## File Structure After Refactoring

```
.cursor/rules/
├── django-development.mdc          # Django development guidelines with Context7 MCP integration
├── playwright-visual-development.mdc  # Playwright MCP testing with Context7 integration
├── context7-mcp-usage.mdc         # Specialized Context7 MCP usage guidelines
└── mcp-integration.mdc            # Multi-MCP ecosystem coordination rules
```

## Recommendations for Future Maintenance

1. **Regular Review**: Review rules quarterly to ensure they align with latest Django and tool versions
2. **Project-Specific Additions**: Add project-specific rules as needed while maintaining the current structure
3. **Tool Updates**: Update Playwright tool references when MCP tools are updated
4. **Best Practice Evolution**: Continuously update best practices based on team learnings and industry standards

## Migration Notes

- All existing functionality is preserved and enhanced
- **Context7 MCP integration** added as primary documentation source without breaking existing workflows
- No breaking changes to existing development workflows
- ngrok configuration is now part of the main Django rules (no separate configuration needed)
- Playwright tool names have been updated to match actual MCP tools
- **New MCP-first approach** prioritizes Context7 for all documentation needs
- **Multi-MCP coordination** enables comprehensive development workflow from research to visual verification

## Context7 MCP Integration Benefits

### Real-time Documentation Access
- **Up-to-date library documentation** directly within development workflow
- **Token-optimized searches** for efficient information retrieval
- **Implementation patterns** and best practices from trusted sources

### Enhanced Development Workflow
1. **Research Phase**: Context7 MCP for patterns and documentation
2. **Implementation Phase**: Context7-guided development practices
3. **Testing Phase**: Playwright MCP with Context7 testing strategies
4. **Documentation Phase**: Context7-sourced best practices documentation

### Quality Assurance Integration
- **Verification strategy**: Context7 suggestions validated through implementation
- **Cross-referencing**: Multiple Context7 sources for comprehensive coverage
- **Visual validation**: Playwright MCP testing of Context7-guided implementations

This refactoring establishes Context7 MCP as the foundation for efficient, well-documented Django development while maintaining comprehensive visual testing capabilities.
